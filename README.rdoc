== README

==Why this was created: 
This was my second project that I created from my General Assembly class. 
I decided to be overly ambitous and make a video game themed dating website. 


==Technologies used:
I created this on rails, used postgresql for the database, and used heroku to host it

==Unsolved problems:
I'm working on getting all of the RESTful routes completed and all of the CRUD operations to work.
