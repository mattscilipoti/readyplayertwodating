## Project Workflow

**Meets expectations**

Decent readme and planning docs.  In the future, it may help to put them into a "planning" folder.  Nice commit history, with meaningful messages.  User Stories are a bit light.  I don't see anything about finding and liking someone.  I see a gh-pages branch (unsure of it's purpose here), but no feature branches. :(

## Technical Requirements

**Does Not Meet Expectations**

I see what you mean by smoke and mirrors. :(

I only see a couple github issues from you.  In the future, please utilize us more.  If I were you, I'd also spend some time thinking about where I should work on my next project.  The "work at home" experiment may have given you solitude, but it also gave you isolation.

What are your plans for this project?

## Creativity / Interface

**Does Not Meet expectations**

Feels like each thing is about 70-80% done.

## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

Like the interface, the app shows signs of thrashing and most things are "mostly" done.  I recommend you pick something small and get it all the way to done.  I made some in-line comments with more details / suggestions for improvement, and happy to pair next week on them if you have any questions.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Does not meet expectations**

If I was Trista, I'd be set. :)

You have a good baseline of an app to build on. It shouldn't take long to  complete these features.
